# Prize Wheel: Circuit Playground BlueFruit
A code for using a Circuit Playground Bluefruit as a prize wheel! Created for the STEM Teachers Open House at the Cox Science Center &amp; Aquarium.

# Software & Hardware
## Circuit Playground 
The hardware used for this project is the Circuit Playground Bluefruit. 4 Circuit Playgrounds are at the Acreage Branch right now, in a wooden case on my desk with "Circuit Playground: Miami Maker Faire". The wooden case also holds alligator clips and data cables.

You can use any one of the Circuit Playgrounds, the software will upload on all of them.

## Arduino
The software used for this project is Arduino, which is free and open source. You can download it onto whatever computer is being used for the outreach using [this link through the Arduino page.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 

## Processing
The software used to pretty-up the output is Processing. This is also a free and open source software. You can download it from (this link through the Processing Foundation.)[https://processing.org/]

# Progress

In the very first demo, it was a simple shake to trigger some lights, a victory tune, and 1 of 2 outputs: a sticker or a bookmark.

<div style="padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/869856084?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="IMG_3640"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Once we got in the prizes, the code got a little more sophisticated. I broke down potential outputs based on the prizes available.

Right now the probabilities are hardcoded in and I'd have to update them on the fly during the event as the prizes run out.

# Todo

I plan to create a Processing sketch to make a very visually appealing output screen for displaying the prizes won, and advertising the game to be played.
